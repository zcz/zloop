You need a few things for a client side scripts development:
	1. IDE(eg. eclipse, optional): a good develop environment, has a lot plug-ins
	2. web browser(eg. chrome): a good web browser can save you a lot of time for debugging
	3. text editor(eg. notepad++): may be eclipse, or notepad++ is also a light and good choice

Scripts language example: 
	1. javascript: I have no idea, but it is quite powerful
	2. Jquery: it is a library based on javascript, just collects some most used function called

How to start:
	1. write a file called ***.html, contains some html, some scripts
	2. open that file with web browser, in which way you can check the result and also debug.
